# Introduction

The `cpputest-for-qpcpp` project enables CppUTest for the 
QP/C++ Real-Time Embedded Framework, and is maintained in a separate repository.
This particular repository holds a top-level example project showing one possible method
for importing the separate library project and one or more example active objects under test.
For more details, please see https://github.com/covemountainsoftware/cpputest-for-qpcpp

# Environment

In theory any build or host operating system environment supported by CppUTest will 
be compatible with this code. Developed primarily in Ubuntu, now at 24.04.

## Prerequisites
* CMake and associated build tools were used to develop
  and prove out this project.
* cpputest-for-qpcpp library, pulled in as a separate git submodule
* qpcpp (pulled in as a separate git submodule)
  * After cloning this repository, do not forget to:
  * `git submodule init`
  * `git submodule update` 
* CppUTest (version 4.0) (may support older versions, but no longer confirmed.)
* This project requires support for C++17 and C11.

## Continuous Integration

This project has configured GitHub Actions to build and execute all
unit tests found in this project. This is an example
of one of the key benefits of host-based testing of embedded software.

See the configuration at: `.github/workflows/cmake.yml`
